#Vehicle Builder

##Description
Vehicle Builder is a command-line application that allows users to create new vehicles or select from existing ones. After selecting or creating a vehicle, users can perform specific actions with the chosen vehicle. The application provides options to work with cars, trucks, and motorbikes, each with unique attributes and actions. This project demonstrates the usage of TypeScript classes, inheritance, and interfaces, with a focus on comprehending and extending existing code bases.
